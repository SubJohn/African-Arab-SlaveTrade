To provide reference material corollary to those already in existence for the Atlantic slave trade for the slave trade in the Indian Ocean, with particular emphasis on slavery on the East African and Middle Eastern littorals. This project seeks to provide both scholars and the public with an accessible means to explore the lived experiences and journeys of slaves through an interactive map tracing both individual and collective slave routes, as well as by providing examples and analysis of slavesâ€™ individual and collective statements collected by British consular and naval authorities. In doing so, this project will provide an overview of the slave trade with individualized histories of slaves that will hopefully provide both scholars and the public with a better understanding of the global phenomenon of slavery and its eventual abolition.
